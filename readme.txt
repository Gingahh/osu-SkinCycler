A program that provides hotkeys for quickly switching between up to 9 different skins while in game.

In config.ini, add the path to your osu! folder and the name of each skin (folder name) you'd like to
assign a hotkey to. Once the necessary changes have been made to config.ini, run the program, open the
osu! client, and change your active skin to SkinCycle. At this point you should be all set! If you can't
find 'SkinCycle' make sure your osu! directory is set correctly.


The hotkeys are as follows:

- alt + numkey (picks the corresponding skin based on the order of the skins you added to config.ini)
- alt + s (cycles to the next skin in the list of skins)

So, if the 'skins' attribute in config looks like this...

skins=[
	"Cookiezi 2016",
	"Rafis DT",
	"rrtyui skin for psychopaths"
	]

...you could press alt+2 to switch to Rafis DT, then alt+1 to switch to Cookiezi 2016, and then alt+s
to switch back to Rafis DT.


Ok, pretty sure that's everything. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to shoot me a
message on something.
